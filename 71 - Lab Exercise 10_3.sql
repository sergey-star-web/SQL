-- 
-- Open the project file F:\10774A_Labs\10774A_10_PRJ\10774A_10_PRJ.ssmssln and the T-SQL script 71 - Lab Exercise 3.sql. Ensure that you are connected to the TSQL2012 database.
--
-- Write a SELECT statement to retrieve the custid and contactname columns from the Sales.Customers table. 
--Add a calculated column named lastorderdate that contains the last order date from the Sales.Orders table for 
--each customer. (Hint: You have to use a correlated subquery.)
--
-- Execute the written statement and compare the results that you got with the recommended result shown in the file 72 - Lab Exercise 3 - Task 1 Result.txt.

-- Task 2

--similar to the request in exercise 2, task 3. However, this time use the EXISTS predicate to filter the results 
--to include only those customers without an order. Also, you do not need to explicitly check that the custid column
--in the Sales.Orders table is not NULL.
--
-- Execute the written statement and compare the results that you got with the recommended result shown in the file 73 - Lab Exercise 3 - Task 2 Result.txt.

--product with a price higher than $100.

-- Task 4
-- 
-- Running aggregates are aggregates that accumulate values over time. Write a SELECT statement to retrieve the 
--following information for each year:
--  The order year
--  The total sales amount
--  The running total sales amount over the years. That is, for each year, return the sum of sales amount up to that year. 
--So, for example, for the earliest year (2006) return the total sales amount, for the next year (2007), return the sum of the 
--total sales amount for the previous year and  the year 2007.

-- The SELECT statement should have three calculated columns:
--  orderyear, representing the order year. This column should be based on the orderyear column from the Sales.Orders table. 
--  totalsales, representing the total sales amount for each year. This column should be based on the qty and unitprice columns 
--from the Sales.OrderDetails table.
--  runsales, representing the running sales amount. This column should use the correlated subquery. 

-- Execute the T-SQL code and compare the results that you got with the recommended result shown in the file 75 - Lab Exercise 3 - Task 4 Result.txt.
