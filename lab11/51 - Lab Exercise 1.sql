-- Task 1
-- 
-- Open the project file F:\10774A_Labs\10774A_11_PRJ\10774A_11_PRJ.ssmssln and the T-SQL script 51 - Lab Exercise 1.sql. 
--To set your database context to that of the TSQL2012 database, highlight the statement USE TSQL2012; and execute 
--the highlighted code. After executing this statement, the TSQL2012 database should be selected in the Available 
--Databases box. In subsequent exercises, you will simply be instructed to ensure that you are connected to the TSQL2012 database.
--
-- Write a SELECT statement to return the productid, productname, supplierid, unitprice, and discontinued columns from the
--Production.Products table. Filter the results to include only products that belong to the category Beverages (categoryid equals 1).
--
-- Observe and compare the results that you got with the desired results shown in the file 52 - Lab Exercise 1 - Task 1 Result.txt.
--
-- Modify the T-SQL code to include the following supplied T-SQL statement. Put this statement before the SELECT clause:
--
-- Execute the complete T-SQL statement. This will create an object view named ProductBeverages under the Production schema.

-- Task 2
-- 
-- Write a SELECT statement to return the productid and productname columns from the Production.ProductsBeverages view.
-- Filter the results to include only products where supplierid equals 1.

-- Task 3
-- 
-- The IT department has written a T-SQL statement that adds an ORDER BY clause to the view created in task 1.
--
-- Execute the provided code. What happened? What is the error message? Why did the query fail?
--
-- Modify the supplied T-SQL statement by including the TOP (100) PERCENT option. The query should look like this: 
--
-- Execute the modified T-SQL statement. By applying the needed changes, you have altered the existing view. Notice that you are still using still use the ORDER BY clause. 
--
-- If you write a query against the modified Production.ProductsBeverages view, will it be guaranteed that the retrieved rows will be sorted by productname? Please explain.

-- Task 4
